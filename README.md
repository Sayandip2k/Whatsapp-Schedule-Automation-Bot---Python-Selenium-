This project is a WhatsApp Web automation bot built with Python, Selenium, and Regex parsing.
It continuously monitors group messages, identifies timetable schedules, and automatically fills assigned slots if empty.

   Key Features:
	•	Web scraping via Selenium WebDriver (Chrome) with persistent login.
	•	Regex-powered slot detection for flexible message parsing.
	•	Smart clipboard + ActionChains automation for reliable pasting & sending.
	•	Handles unexpected popups/dialogs gracefully.
	•	Preserves original formatting & emojis in the updated schedule.
	•	Runs autonomously in a polling loop for real-time updates.

 This project turns WhatsApp into a collaborative scheduling tool without using external APIs.
